* Write comprehensive tests for Quantity.Parse() and Quantity.ToString().

* Use the "c" format specifier to format currencies correctly. Include a locale code with each
  currency code.

* Write lots of tests for everything, starting with BaseUnit, Unit, and Quantity.
* Look for TODO tags.

* Add ConvertTo() method to convert to a specified unit.
* Add support for parsing sequences, e.g. "5 ft 10 in".
* Add ToSiDerivedUnits() which will look for compound units that can be replaced by derived units.

Maybe later:
* Add support for currency codes.
* Add support for unit kinds.
